        <td class='post-text'>Nausea & Prenatal vitamins Morning/all day nausea here. 

The moment I feel like Iâ€™m good for taking my prenatal vitamins.... within 10-15min of taking them I throw up. 

Question: 

Do I need to take them again or since i actually swallowed is that okay for todayâ€™s dose ?
