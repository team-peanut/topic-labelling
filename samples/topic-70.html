        <td class='post-text'>Bottle formula feeding when out... Hi mummas. My little girl is just over 3 weeks. I have now switched to formula only. 
When going out is it ok to fill bottles with 90ml boiling water which will cool. Then when she wants a bottle to add 30ml of fresh boiled water and powder? 

Thanks.</td>
